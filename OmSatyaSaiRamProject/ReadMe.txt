Readme fileCourse project main folder has the following files inside.1. Project Report2. This readme file.3. To run the code for results, upload the files with Ô.mÕ extension into your MATLAB workspace and the images you want to test.4.  Open the FruitAgeDetection.m file5. In this file, you will find the code in sections. In section Ð 2, line -1(imread() command), change the name of the image to the desired image you want to check the results for and run the whole code.6. The images names are in this format. ÔDx.y.jpg.' Here, x -> (the day the image is captured), y -> (number of the image taken on that day)7. To test the rate of increase in the patch size day-to-day open PatchIncrease.m file and run the code.Note: For 8 there is no necessity to change any images because the different patch in each picture of a day is given already. This code is similar to the code in FruitAgeDetection.m file. The outputs are different.
